Project Details!!
 Hey guys, Me Shivani this side. 
So we all need to make a project for resolving the problem of our University's panitry. 
All we require as guided by our Mam Anshu is: 
1.to maintain the database for all blocks and then for each floor of each block. 
2.online transaction. 
3.inter connection between the square one database and panitry app. 
4.The code we need to write is to record the timings of the teachers that is at what time they will be free and they will be served with food. 
5.it should maintain the record of the days,teacher had ordered the food. 
Only these things are striking in my mind.If anyone remember something else.Please be free to change.

Thanks.
